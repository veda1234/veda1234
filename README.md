ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @veda1234, a full stack developer and enthusiast of Data Science.
 I am skilled in languages like Python, Java, C++, C. I have worked with Flask, Django, .NET, React.js, MySQL, Redis, Docker, Git and have done deployment work as well.

I have interest in the stock market, wherein I have done basic algorithmic trading strategies - creating technical indicators(VWAP, EMA etc), stop losses, backtesting etc with Python.

I would love to be a part of a team/project/company where I can contribute, showcase my consistency and abilities. I love learning new things and I am quite flexible when it comes to working with new technologies.
